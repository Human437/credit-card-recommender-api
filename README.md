# Credit Card Recommender API

 Too often people grow up not knowing much about credit cards or in a household where credit cards are demonized, while in reality they are pretty useful tools to get cash back and travel opportunities if used correctly. This app was created with the intention of helping those who are new to credit cards make an educated choice with regards to the user's first 5 credit cards. You will input your information to get a credit card recommendation based on your credit score, the number of cards you currently have, annual income, student status, and last hard inquiry.

This is the back-end of the app. You can check out the repo for the client [here](https://github.com/Human437/credit-card-recommender) or you can view it live [here](https://credit-card-recommender.vercel.app/).
