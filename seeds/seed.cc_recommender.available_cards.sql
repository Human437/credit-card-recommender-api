  ('Discover IT Student','As the name suggests, this card is meant for students and has the additional good grades benefit that most students would appreciate. The good grades benefit in short gives you a $20 statement credit each school year you have a GPA that is 3.0 or higher. Aside from special features for students, it functions essentially the same way the regular Discover IT card functions. It has the same rotating categories that will give you 5% back on purchases that fit under the category and 1% back on everything else. On top of that Discover’s intro bonus is that they will double all the rewards you earn in the first year once you have held the card for one year. So let''s say you opened an account on February 6th, 2020, and held the card till at the very least February 6th, 2021, Discover will match the cashback you earned. If you earned $100 in cashback, Discover will give you an additional $100 credit. So for a little effort on your part, you could be earning money back on all your purchases. Another perk with Discover is that, at least at the time of writing, all of their customer support is based in the United States so you won’t have to deal with people who you may have a hard time understanding when you run into issues as a new credit cardholder. Also, without an annual fee, you can keep this card forever even when you start moving on to higher-tier cards.','https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fborrowingbetter.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F07%2FDiscover-it-Student-Cash-Back-Credit-Card.jpg&f=1&nofb=1'),
  ('Chase Sapphire Prefered','This is going to be your entry-level travel card that just fits the sweet spot of having access to Chase’s Ultimate Rewards portal without having to shell out a $550 annual fee. You won’t have as many perks as the Chase Sapphire Reserve, but you are also paying a fifth of the cost. This card is perfect for people who are getting their first credit card that has an annual fee and are still on the fence about whether or not they can justify getting a card with an annual fee. If you happen to be one of the people who are on the fence about whether or not you can justify the $95 annual fee just get it. Worst-case scenario you realize that the card is of no benefit to you, you will still walk away with an additional $400. For clarity''s sake, the $400 is the 50,000 points on sign-up bonus after spending $4,000 in the first 3 months converted to a statement credit minus the annual fee for the first year. After the first year, you can downgrade the card or close it entirely. Also, this card is great for those who aren’t sure if they can take full advantage of the travel benefits the card offers. As a final word, its earnings categories are 2X points on dining and travel, 1X points on everything else, and for a limited time till April 30, 2021, 2X points on grocery store purchases.','https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abroaders.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F03%2F1515869_Chase_Sapphire_Preferred_Card_Art-June_2012.jpg&f=1&nofb=1'),
  ('Chase Sapphire Reserve','This is essentially the better version of the Chase Sapphire Preferred, but at five times the price. While the high annual fee of $550 may steer some people away from it at first, remember the large number of benefits and credits the card offers. Most of the credits help pay for the card itself like the $300 Annual Travel Credit that is pretty easy to use and at the time of writing can be used at gas stations and grocery stores due to covid-19. So, if you believe that you can make full use of the benefits the card has to offer and you know that you will be traveling a lot, this is a great card to add to your arsenal. As a final word, its earnings categories are 3X points on dining and travel, 1X points on everything else, and for a limited time till April 30, 2021, 3X points on grocery store purchases.','https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kinja-img.com%2Fgawker-media%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fs--1jAznzwr--%2Fc_fill%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_900%2Cq_80%2Cw_1600%2Ft23hrzfuukxi6zape1wa.jpg&f=1&nofb=1'),
  ('Discover IT Cash Back','This is the perfect starter card for everyone who has never had a credit card before and is not a student. It offers rotating categories with 5% back if a purchase falls under one of those categories and 1% back on everything else. Discover will also match all the cashback you earn in the first year. So let''s say you opened an account on February 6th, 2020, and held the card till at the very least February 6th, 2021, Discover will match the cashback you earned. If you earned $100 in cashback, Discover will give you an additional $100 credit. So for a little effort on your part, you could be earning money back on all your purchases. Another perk with Discover is that, at least at the time of writing, all of their customer support is based in the United States so you won’t have to deal with people who you may have a hard time understanding when you run into issues as a new credit cardholder.

  ('American Express Gold','This card is American Express’s essentially equivalent to the Chase Sapphire Preferred. The annual fee is $250 but has its own set of credits that help offset the costs. One notable credit is the $120 Uber Eats where you get $10 in Uber Cash each month. So if you happen to be someone who regularly uses Uber Eats you have effectively reduced your annual fee to $130. The card is perfect for those just getting into the Amex ecosystem and regularly make use of dining, groceries, and flight categories. The card will get 4X back on dining and groceries, 3X back on flights, and 1X back on everything else. On a side note, the card looks pretty cool and who doesn’t want to have a metal credit card. However, you <strong>should NOT</strong> and I repeat <strong>should NOT</strong> just get the card just because it looks cool or you want to “flex” on people.

  ('American Express Platinum','This card is American Express’s essentially equivalent to the Chase Sapphire Reserve. The annual fee is $550 but has its own set of credits that help offset the costs.

On a side note, the card has a very polished look to it, and who doesn’t want to have a metal credit card.

  ('Chase Freedom Unlimited','This is one of Chase’s beginner-oriented credit cards without an annual fee that doesn’t have any frills and will provide you with 5X back on travel purchased through Chase, 3X back on dining, and 1.5X back on everything else. Something to note is that the card is marketed as a cashback credit card, but in reality, they are points that can then be turned into a statement credit card. This means that you have the option to save the points that you earn from using the card till you get a higher tier card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred which has an additional multiplier of 1.25 for all points in the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal to get extra value. This is the perfect second card for anyone who is just getting into the credit card game and doesn’t want a card that follows the “it just works” approach. There is no need to worry about rotating categories to maximize your earnings, you essentially just get 1.5X back flat on everything.','https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankdealguy.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F10%2Fchase-freedom-unlim.png&f=1&nofb=1'),
  ('Chase Freedom Flex','This is one of Chase’s beginner-oriented credit cards without an annual fee that is a bit more involved and will provide you with 5X back on travel purchased through Chase and the rotating categories, 3X back on dining, and 1.5X back on everything else. Something to note is that the card is marketed as a cashback credit card, but in reality, they are points that can then be turned into a statement credit card.

Perhaps you followed our recommendation and have the Discover IT Student cash back card. If you enjoyed taking advantage of the 5X back rotating categories to get the most value, you will likely enjoy doing the same with the Chase Freedom Flex.','https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200911004346-underscored-chase-freedom-flex-on-background-live-video.jpg&f=1&nofb=1')
